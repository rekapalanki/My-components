            <h2>Calculating the size of the footer</h2>
            <p>There are several resolutions of creating a footer. If the content exceeds the height of the viewport,
                then there is no need to fix it to the bottom. If the content is smaller than the viewport, then the
                footer actually needs to positioned to the bottom of the page. There are several opportunities to fulfil
                that. <br>
                One opportunity is that the whole content needs to be wrapped into one single container. Then,
                let's set the container's position to absolute and its height needs to set to 100vh. Then, set the
                footer's position to absolute and position it to the bottom of the page.<br>
                <strong>Problem:</strong> It works only if the footer's height is fixed. Not a big deal, just know about
                it. <br><br>
                Another solution is to set the footer outside the wrapper. Then, calculate the height of the wrapper by
                excluding the height of the footer. <br>
                <strong>Problem:</strong> In this case, the height of the footer needs to be set as well.<br><br>
